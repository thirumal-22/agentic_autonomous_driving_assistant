```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-autonomous-driving-assistant.git
cd agentic-autonomous-driving-assistant
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project folder:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Step 4: Run the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## 🔍 Technical Deep-Dive

### 1. OpenCV Lane Detection Pipeline
The lane tracking uses a classical CV approach to segment boundary markers:
- **Pre-processing**: Grayscale conversion followed by `GaussianBlur` to filter high-frequency sensor noise.
- **Feature Extraction**: `Canny` Edge Detection identifies pixels corresponding to line markings.
- **ROI Masking**: Apply a trapezoidal mask focusing on the vehicle's driving corridor.
- **Hough Line Transform**: `HoughLinesP` clusters edge pixels into lines. Left lane marks (negative slope) and Right lane marks (positive slope) are filtered and extrapolated to project green overlay lanes.
- **Departure Estimation**: The difference between the frame center (vehicle center) and the lane polygon center is computed to throw directional alerts.

### 2. YOLOv8 Deep Learning Detector
- Object detection runs on `yolov8n.pt` to detect dynamic entities (vehicles, pedestrians) and static traffic signs (stop signs, lights).
- Distance is estimated dynamically using the inverse relationship of object height and perspective:
  $$Distance = \frac{Calibration Factor}{Bounding Box Height Fraction}$$

### 3. Agent Coordination (LangGraph)
- State transitions are coordinated as a directed sequence.
- State schema retains raw frames, OpenCV drawings, object lists, calculated hazards, and explanations.

### 4. Safety Validation (Failsafe Guard)
- Generative AI models are subject to hallucinations, latency, or API disconnects.
- To achieve industry-grade reliability, the final control command must pass a **deterministic enforcer** checking immediate constraints (proximity boundaries, blind spot occupancy) before emitting steering commands.

## 🧪 Verification & Testing Strategy
Run unit tests to verify agent state transitions and override correctness:
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## 💼 Recruiter Guide & Resume Ready Descriptions

### Resume Description (ATS-Friendly)
> **AI & Autonomous Systems Engineer**
> *Developed a multi-agent autonomous driving assistant utilizing Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, LangGraph, and Gemini 1.5. Configured a DAG-based orchestration pipeline coordinating Perception, Environment, Decision, Reasoning, and Safety Validation agents. Engineered OpenCV lane tracking algorithms rendering departure warnings alongside YOLO-based distance estimators. Built a dual-layer decision engine securing operations via a deterministic validation layer protecting against generative model hallucinations.*

### Core Interview Explanations
1. **Why LangGraph for ADAS?**
   *By decoupling perception from planning and safety, we avoid monolithic coding. Each agent performs one task. For instance, updating safety boundaries is done in the Safety Agent without refactoring OpenCV code. Additionally, it models asynchronous processing patterns used in real-world systems (like ROS).*
   
2. **How does the system handle Gemini failures?**
   *A deterministic local fallback engine immediately generates safe justifications if the API times out or throws an error. This follows standard safety principles: control and safety actions are local, while explainability can fail gracefully without crashing the vehicle.*

## Deployment: Fixing OpenCV import errors

If you see errors like `ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` while deploying (common on Streamlit Cloud or minimal Docker images), add the missing system packages.

- For Streamlit Community Cloud: a `packages.txt` file is supported and will be installed during the build. This repository includes `packages.txt` with the required packages.

- For Debian/Ubuntu servers or Docker images, install:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0
```

- Make sure the Python wheel is the headless OpenCV build (no GUI dependencies):

```bash
pip uninstall -y opencv-python opencv-python-headless
pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall opencv-python-headless
```

These steps resolve the `libGL.so.1` missing error and allow `cv2` to import successfully.
